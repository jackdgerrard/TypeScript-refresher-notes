if you're reading this on GitHub, embedding doesn't work. you should jyst click the link in src, give Mosh a like, follow and subscribe because he puts a lot of great education out into the world that's freely available.

## What is TypeScript

it's a superset of JS Anything you can do with JS can be done with TS. 

### Benefits

Static typing over JS default dynamic typing - TS is JS with type checking, so we can catch mistakes at transpilation instead of weird edge cases found in prod. 

typing is about how you declare you're variables. 

VS code and Codium have great features for linting, code completion(intellisense), refactoring, 

new features for cleaner and consise code compatible with more browsers and run times


### supposed drawbacks 
- transpilation is supposedly a drawback but it's grand
- requires more thought to be put into the types you declare your variables to be.


## install 
 do this - https://nodejs.org/en/download
 then, do this - https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/

 install it globally to make use of the `tsc` CLI command

 don't over think it unless you're working on prod repo's. If you're reading this you're not, so just do that and that. 

## for Git repossitories, here are some files that are good to ignore: 

```
# Node.js
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.pnpm-debug.log*
.npm/

# TypeScript
*.tsbuildinfo
dist/ # Your compiled JavaScript output directory
.tsc/ # Sometimes used for incremental compilation outputs

# IDEs and Editors
.vscode/ # VS Code settings (optional, but often preferred to be ignored)
.idea/   # IntelliJ IDEA
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace

# OS and temporary files
.DS_Store
launch.json
Thumbs.db
.env # Environment variables (crucial for sensitive data)
.env.*
*.log
*.tmp
*.bak
```

When pushing your Node.js TypeScript project to GitHub, you should ignore files and directories that are generated, temporary, or contain sensitive information. This keeps your repository clean, lean, and secure, and avoids committing files that might cause conflicts or are specific to your local environment.

You do this by creating a file named .gitignore in the root of your project. Here's a comprehensive list of common items to include:

#### Node.js
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.pnpm-debug.log*
.npm/

#### TypeScript
*.tsbuildinfo
dist/ # Your compiled JavaScript output directory
.tsc/ # Sometimes used for incremental compilation outputs

#### IDEs and Editors
.vscode/ # VS Code settings (optional, but often preferred to be ignored)
launch.json
.idea/   # IntelliJ IDEA
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace

#### OS and temporary files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.env # Environment variables (crucial for sensitive data)
.env.*
*.log
*.tmp
*.bak

### Why Ignore These Items?
node_modules/: This directory contains all the packages (dependencies) your project relies on. It can be very large. Anyone cloning your repository can easily regenerate this folder by running npm install (or yarn install, pnpm install).

npm-debug.log*, yarn-debug.log*, etc.: These are debug logs generated by package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm). They're only relevant for troubleshooting on your local machine.

*.tsbuildinfo: This file is created by TypeScript for faster incremental builds. It's specific to your local build process.

dist/: This is your output directory where TypeScript compiles your .ts files into .js files. You only commit source code (.ts), not compiled output. Your tsconfig.json correctly points to this.

.vscode/, .idea/, etc.: These directories contain IDE-specific configuration files (e.g., workspace settings, debugger configurations). While sometimes useful to share in a team, they often contain personal preferences or paths specific to individual developers and can cause unnecessary churn in version control. It's usually best to ignore them.

.DS_Store, Thumbs.db: These are operating system-specific files for directory metadata (macOS and Windows, respectively) and are not part of your project's code.

.env, .env.*: These files often contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other environment-specific variables. They should never be committed to version control, especially public repositories. Instead, these values are typically managed through environment variables on your deployment server or a secure vault.

*.log, *.tmp, *.bak: These are general temporary or backup files that aren't part of your project's source code.

By adding these to your .gitignore file, Git will automatically ignore them when you run git add or git commit, 


## syntax

JS: 

```var age=20;```

now age can be changed to a string

TS: 
```let age: number = 20;```


now age can't ever be a string


for style guides, just use a linter, nobody's got time to reformat for any Senior dev's opinion on the correct styling but you should be neat and consistent:

https://palantir.github.io/tslint/ is advisable but is deprecated. 




## setting the ts config file to determine how transpiler(tsc) behaves

most settings are commented out by default

create a typescript project with `tsc --init` if it's installed globally.

if you remove a value you can press ctrl+space to see what can be added

if you wnat to change any values here it's mostly going to be for the "target" parameter that is the version of JS that your code will be transpiled to
or modules 



---
For nodeJS

Open your tsconfig.json and ensure the compilerOptions section contains: 

- "moduleResolution": "node": Instructs TypeScript to use Node.js's module resolution strategy to find imports.
- "types": ["node"]: This explicitly tells the compiler to include the Node.js type definitions that you just installed.
- "include": ["server.ts"]: Tells TypeScript which files to compile.

## How to debugging

when code doesn't do what you thought it would 

check the tsconfig.json and under emit enable sourceMap to check how source code in TS matches to the JS code that gets output from transpiler, you'' see this in index.js.map, but note that it's not for humans to really understand. It's for debuggers. 

use breakpoints if your text editor supports it. VSCode, Codium And Visual Studio do. breakpoints will run until a breakpoint at which point the process will pause 

In VScode,
-  go to the "Run and Debug tab"
- "create a launch.json file"
- from dropdown, pick "node.js"
- a new file is created, launch.json
- add `"preLaunchTask": "tsc: build - tsconfig.json",` to launch.json in between "program" and "output files"
- ensure launch.json is in the .gitignore
- it tells vscode to use tsc to transpile the code first

this gets funky when using WSL with Codium, I'm not partaking in this section of Mosh's video 

## Typescript in detail 

JS has types like: 
- number
- string
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- object

Typescript has these as well as the following to facilitate it's strict typing 

Typescript makes assumptions of what type a variable should be based on the value. Typescript calls this an *implicit* type

```Typescript
let sales = 12345; //assumed to be a number
let language = "Typescript";  //assumed to be a string
let isPublished = true; //assumed to be a boolean
let ambiguousObject; //assumed to be a "any". 

```

### the any type

a new type for TS. 

if it's not initialized, as above, it's assumed to be an "any". 

using any is not a good practice, it defeats the point of typescripts strict typing feature. 

a good practice is to use noImplicityAny in the tsconfig section to turn off implicit any commands - this is like hard mode, but if you've worked with OOP languages before you'll be fine

### arrays

in JS we decalre an array like this: 
```JavaScript
var numbers = [1,2,3]; 
```

and also 

```JavaScript
let numbers = [1,true, 'three', {4, false, 'six'}]; 
```

because JS is *wild* and doesn't give af about types

in TS we have strict typing, right, so we don't party like that anymore. 

We basically behave more like the other "grown up languages", in our shirts and ties, and we declare our arrays to be a list of typed variables: 

```TypeScript

let numbers: number[] = [1,2,3];
```

or 

```TypeScript
let strings: string[] = ["one","two", "three"];
```

```TypeScript
//I'm really unsure about this
let numbers: objects[] = [{nul},{1,2,3},{"one", "two", "three"}];
```



### Tuples

### Enums

### Functions

### Objects 

##### about the example code: 
server side rendered template node JS webserver that works on markdown files. why not? My undergrad degree is in Web Development so I might as well use it for once. 

to run it, git pull the directory, compile it with tsc and run the server.js file in /dist

for containers, your entrypoint is /dist/server.js
