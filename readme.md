## What is TypeScript

it's a superset of JS Anything you can do with JS can be done with TS. 

### Benefits

Static typing over JS default dynamic typing - TS is JS with type checking, so we can catch mistakes at transpilation instead of weird edge cases found in prod. 

typing is about how you declare you're variables. 

VS code and Codium have great features for linting, code completion, refactoring 

new features for cleaner and consise code compatible with more browsers and run times


### supposed drawbacks 
- transpilation is supposedly a drawback but it's grand
- requires more thought to be put into the types you declare your variables to be.


## install 
 do this - https://nodejs.org/en/download
 then, do this - https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/

 install it globally to make use of the `tsc` CLI command

 don't over think it unless you're working on prod repo's. If you're reading this you're not, so just do that and that. 

## for Git repossitories, here are some files that are good to ignore: 

```
# Node.js
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.pnpm-debug.log*
.npm/

# TypeScript
*.tsbuildinfo
dist/ # Your compiled JavaScript output directory
.tsc/ # Sometimes used for incremental compilation outputs

# IDEs and Editors
.vscode/ # VS Code settings (optional, but often preferred to be ignored)
.idea/   # IntelliJ IDEA
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace

# OS and temporary files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.env # Environment variables (crucial for sensitive data)
.env.*
*.log
*.tmp
*.bak
```

When pushing your Node.js TypeScript project to GitHub, you should ignore files and directories that are generated, temporary, or contain sensitive information. This keeps your repository clean, lean, and secure, and avoids committing files that might cause conflicts or are specific to your local environment.

You do this by creating a file named .gitignore in the root of your project. Here's a comprehensive list of common items to include:

#### Node.js
node_modules/
npm-debug.log*
yarn-debug.log*
yarn-error.log*
.pnpm-debug.log*
.npm/

#### TypeScript
*.tsbuildinfo
dist/ # Your compiled JavaScript output directory
.tsc/ # Sometimes used for incremental compilation outputs

#### IDEs and Editors
.vscode/ # VS Code settings (optional, but often preferred to be ignored)
.idea/   # IntelliJ IDEA
*.sublime-project
*.sublime-workspace

#### OS and temporary files
.DS_Store
Thumbs.db
.env # Environment variables (crucial for sensitive data)
.env.*
*.log
*.tmp
*.bak

### Why Ignore These Items?
node_modules/: This directory contains all the packages (dependencies) your project relies on. It can be very large. Anyone cloning your repository can easily regenerate this folder by running npm install (or yarn install, pnpm install).

npm-debug.log*, yarn-debug.log*, etc.: These are debug logs generated by package managers (npm, yarn, pnpm). They're only relevant for troubleshooting on your local machine.

*.tsbuildinfo: This file is created by TypeScript for faster incremental builds. It's specific to your local build process.

dist/: This is your output directory where TypeScript compiles your .ts files into .js files. You only commit source code (.ts), not compiled output. Your tsconfig.json correctly points to this.

.vscode/, .idea/, etc.: These directories contain IDE-specific configuration files (e.g., workspace settings, debugger configurations). While sometimes useful to share in a team, they often contain personal preferences or paths specific to individual developers and can cause unnecessary churn in version control. It's usually best to ignore them.

.DS_Store, Thumbs.db: These are operating system-specific files for directory metadata (macOS and Windows, respectively) and are not part of your project's code.

.env, .env.*: These files often contain sensitive information like API keys, database credentials, or other environment-specific variables. They should never be committed to version control, especially public repositories. Instead, these values are typically managed through environment variables on your deployment server or a secure vault.

*.log, *.tmp, *.bak: These are general temporary or backup files that aren't part of your project's source code.

By adding these to your .gitignore file, Git will automatically ignore them when you run git add or git commit, 


## syntax

JS: 

```var age=20;```

now age can be changed to a string

TS: 
```let age: number = 20;```


now age can't ever be a string


for style guides, just use a linter, nobody's got time to reformat for any Senior dev's opinion on the correct styling but you should be neat and consistent:

https://palantir.github.io/tslint/ is advisable but is deprecated. 




## setting the ts config file to determine how transpiler(tsc) behaves

most settings are commented out by default

create a typescript project with `tsc --init` if it's installed globally.

if you remove a value you can press ctrl+space to see what can be added

if you wnat to change any values here it's mostly going to be for the "target" parameter that is the version of JS that your code will be transpiled to
or modules

For nodeJS

Open your tsconfig.json and ensure the compilerOptions section contains: 

- "moduleResolution": "node": Instructs TypeScript to use Node.js's module resolution strategy to find imports.
- "types": ["node"]: This explicitly tells the compiler to include the Node.js type definitions that you just installed.
- "include": ["server.ts"]: Tells TypeScript which files to compile.

##### about the example code: 
server side rendered template node JS webserver that works on markdown files. why not? My undergrad degree is in Web Development so I might as well use it for once.
